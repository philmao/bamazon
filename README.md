<h1>Bamazon</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Create an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL to take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.  As a bonus task, your app may be able to track product sales across your store's departments and then provide a summary of the highest-grossing departments in the store.
